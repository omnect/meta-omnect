# Note:
#   U-Boot might crash if a USB endpoint is in state halted during enumeration,
#   and unfortunately this is the case with the LTE modem Sierra Wireless
#   AirPrime EM7455 attached to an RPI 4 as recently used in the test farm.
#   As a workaround disable USB in U-Boot as we don't currently need it for
#   booting and would generally rule out any interference with attached devices.
#   A question was sent to the U-Boot mailing list concerning this problem,
#   maybe future versions are capable of handling that.
