# ICS_DeviceManagement - meta-ics-dm yocto layer

What is ICS_DeviceManagement?: https://lp.conplement.de/ics-devicemanagement

## Features
This yocto meta layer provides the poky based ICS_DeviceManagement distribution `ics-dm-os`. It includes recipes for:
- [iot-hub-device-update](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update)
- [iot-identity-service](https://github.com/Azure/iot-identity-service)
- [iotedge](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge)

- `ics-os-dm-update-image` a `swupdate` Image with A/B rootfs update support
- demo: auto device enrollment via `tpm` (not intended for production) with `tpm` provisioning configuration of  `iot-identity-service`
    - `iot-hub-device-update` and `iotedge` get provisioned via `iot-identity-service`
- A/B update support for [raspberrypi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) 3 and 4
- A/B update support for [odroid-c2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c2/)
- first boot script `/usr/bin/ics_dm_first_boot.sh` which is executed at first boot of the device; it can be adapted via `meta-ics-dm/recipes-core/systemd/systemd/ics_dm_first_boot.sh`
- wifi commissioning via bluetooth

### `DISTRO_FEATURES`
`ics-dm-os` depends on [poky](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-item/poky/).
It is built with the default `poky` `DISTRO_FEATURES`.

`meta-ics-dm` adds the following `DISTRO_FEATURES`:
- `ics-dm-demo`
    - adds an automatic device enrollment demo with provisioning via tpm
    - synchronizes startup of `iot-identity-service` with the enrollment demo
    - depends on `DISTRO_FEATURES` including `tpm` which is not added automatically!
- `iotedge`
    - adds the `iotedge` service with its dependencies
    - adds `virtualization` to `DISTRO_FEATURES` (from [meta-virtualization](https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/meta-virtualization)) needed by `iotedge` runtime dependency `moby`
- `persistent-journal`
    - enables a persistent journal which is stored in the data partition
- `resize-data`
    - expands the data partition to available space on first boot
- `tpm`
    - adds tpm kernel overlay, driver and auto modprobe.
    (**Currently you have to enable it explicitly for `ics-dm-demo`, since enrollment depends hard on tpm.**)
- `wifi-commissioning`
    - adds a service which enables wifi commissioning via bluetooth
    - this is only intended for demo purposes; this is not a production ready service
    - depends on `DISTRO_FEATURES` `wifi` and `bluetooth` which are not added to `DISTRO_FEATURES` automatically!

### `EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES`
`meta-ics-dm` adds the following configurable `EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES`:
- `ics-dm-debug`
    - eis_utils: enables output of connection- and identity string

### Partion Layout
`ics-dm-os` uses an `A/B` update partition layout with two readonly rootfs partitions.
The partition layout is
```sh
Device         Boot   Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/mmcblkXp1 *       8192    90111    81920   40M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/mmcblkXp2       106496  1628159  1521664  743M 83 Linux
/dev/mmcblkXp3      1630208  3151871  1521664  743M 83 Linux
/dev/mmcblkXp4      3153918 31116287 27962370 13.3G  f W95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/mmcblkXp5      3153920  3235839    81920   40M 83 Linux
/dev/mmcblkXp6      3244032  3325951    81920   40M 83 Linux
/dev/mmcblkXp7      3334144  3416063    81920   40M 83 Linux
/dev/mmcblkXp8      3424256 31116287 27692032 13.2G 83 Linux
```
- `mmcblkXp1` is the `boot` partition with vfat filesystem
- `mmcblkXp2` is the readonly `rootA` partition with ext4 filesystem
- `mmcblkXp3` is the readonly `rootB` partition with ext4 filesystem
- `mmcblkXp5` is the writable `factory` partition with ext4 filesystem
- `mmcblkXp6` is the writable `certificate` partition with ext4 filesystem
- `mmcblkXp7` is the writable `etc` overlay partition (ext4 filesystem mounted as overlayfs on `/etc`)
- `mmcblkXp8` is the writable `data` partition with ext4 filesystem

The size of `mmcblkXp8` depends on your sdcard/emmc size. Per default it has a size of 512M and is resized on the first boot to the max available size.

There is a reserved area between the boot partition and the rootA partition used for two redundant u-boot environment banks.
For this purpose, the following configuration variables are used:

- `ICS_DM_PART_OFFSET_UBOOT_ENV1`
    - offset of 1st u-boot environment bank (in KiB, decimal)
- `ICS_DM_PART_OFFSET_UBOOT_ENV2`
    - offset of 2nd u-boot environment bank (in KiB, decimal)
- `ICS_DM_PART_SIZE_UBOOT_ENV`
    - size of one u-boot environment bank (in KiB, decimal)

## Compatibility
`meta-ics-dm` is compatible with the current yocto LTS release branch `dunfell`.

## Versioning
We reflect the used poky version in our version schema. `ics-dm-os` is versioned via `POKY_VERSION.BUILD_NR`, `3.1.x.y` where `x` is poky dunnfell's patch version and `y` is our build number.

## Dependencies
`meta-ics-dm` depends on:
- [meta-rust](https://github.com/meta-rust/meta-rust.git) (mandatory)
- [meta-swupdate](https://github.com/sbabic/meta-swupdate.git) (mandatory)
- [meta-virtualization](https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/meta-virtualization) (optional - via dynamic layer, iotedge depends on it)
- [meta-odroid](https://github.com/akuster/meta-odroid.git") (optional - via dynamic layer, odroid-c2 support depends on it)
- [meta-raspberrypi]("https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi.git") (optional - via dynamic layer, raspberrypi support depends on it)

## Configuration

For using `ics-dm-os-update-image` together with `iot-hub-device-update` you have to provide a rsa-key for signing/verifying the update image.
Note: We currently only support `swupdate` RSA signing.
Provide the environment Variables `SWUPDATE_PASSWORD_FILE` and `SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
 - `SWUPDATE_PASSWORD_FILE` - full path to a file containing the keys password
 - `SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY` - full path of private key file
```sh
# How to generate SWUPDATE_PASSWORD_FILE and SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY
echo "your password" > priv.pass
openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout file:priv.pass -out priv.pem
# SWUPDATE_PASSWORD_FILE = $(pwd)/priv.pass
# SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY = $(pwd)/priv.pem
```

# Todo's
- document: image needs postprocessing via `ics-dm-cli` to get
  - mandatory: an `iot-identity-service` configuration (provisioning)
  - mandatory if activated: an `ics-dm-demo` configuration (enrollment)
  - optional: an `iot-hub-device-update` configuration
- document: kas usage with example `kas/ics-dm-os-iot-rpi3.yaml` and
  `kas/ics-dm-os-iotedge-rpi4.yaml` and how to add features
- ??? document flashing/updating an example rpi4 device???
