# OMNECT_ADU_DEVICEPROPERTIES_COMPATIBILITY_ID
Used to configure compatibility between online updates. E.g. if you increase from `0` to `1` an online update via omnect portal is not possible.
You have to reflash the device with the new image version containing OMNECT_ADU_DEVICEPROPERTIES_COMPATIBILITY_ID = "1".
