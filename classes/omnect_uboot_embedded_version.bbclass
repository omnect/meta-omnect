# This class implements a function to embed u-boot version in bootloader
# binary.
#
# Actually it is the other way round: the built binary gets extended to place
# the version information into the newly allocated space at the configured
# offset.
#
# There are two cases of bootloader binaries:
#  - binary blob directly written to flash space at a certain offset
#    (common U-Boot case)
#  - binary file in boot filesystem
#    (special Raspberry Pi case where 2nd stage bootloader resides in
#     kernel8.img)
#
# The bootloader version itself doesn't get computed here but in class
# omnect_bootloader_versioning.bbclass which also writes the computed version
# to file omnect_bootloader_version in DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE.
#
# The following bitbake variables control how the version information gets
# embedded:
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_BBTARGET
#    defines the bitbake target the versioned bootloader binary bases upon
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_BINFILE
#    the name of the base binary bootloader file; the generated file will be at
#    the same path but with a suffix '.versioned', the original file gets
#    suffixed with '.unversioned' and a link gets created from the original
#    file name to the '.versioned' file so that subsequent processes take the
#    correct file as input.
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_TYPE
#    this can be either "file" or "flash", defining of which type the binary is
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_PARAMSIZE
#    number of bytes to reserve for version information
#    (and maybe others in future)
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_IMAGESIZE
#    final size of bootloader binary including version information block.
#    this parameter is only used for "flash" type bootloaders which have a
#    pre-defined flash area to reside in, in order to use space at specific
#    offset from end of region
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_IMAGEOFFSET
#    only used for type "flash" and only to find correct bootloader location
#    (and hence version information location) during runtime
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_IMAGEGZ
#    is set to any value a gzipped version is created, too, during image
#    creation bootloader.bin.versioned.gz is also created
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_LOCATION
#    defines the run-time location of the bootloader and is a file path for
#    type "file"; in case boot loader is part of flash it is assumed that it
#    resides in the same device as the root filesystem
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_MAGIC
#    a magic number precedes the actual version string, followed by a length
#    byte containing the length of the following string, i.e. w/o magic number
#    and length byte; it is defined as string containing hexadecimal values
#    w/o preceding "0x" (as common in many programming languages), e.g.:
#      "de ad be ef"
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_FILLBYTE
#    optionally defines the byte to be used to fill space between original
#    boot loader binary and version data, and also fro end of version data
#    up to defined size of resulting file; default value is 0x00
#    however, for NOR flashes it would be better to have an 0xff, therefore
#    this variable
#  - OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_UUUTAG
#    if bootloader is used for production programming, i.e. uuu tool flashes
#    boot medium via ROM serial boot, it needs an end tag for the tool to
#    detect its size.
#    if this option is set to anything but the empty string the binary gets
#    tagged, by default no tagging happens.
#
# format of version information is:
#
#    byteoffset: | 0 ... n | (n + 1)  | (n + 2) ... (n + 1 + *n) |
#    ------------+---------+----------+--------------------------+
#    meaning:    | <magic> | <length> | <version string>
#
# where:
#  - <magic> is defined by variable OMNECT_BOOTLOADER_EMBEDDED_VERSION_MAGIC
#  - <length> is one byte specifying length of <version string>
#  - <version string> is the actual version, w/o terminating character
#
