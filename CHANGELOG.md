## [kirkstone-0.22.9] Q4 2023
- omnect-device-service: update to version 0.14.4

## [kirkstone-0.22.8] Q4 2023

  - updated meta-virtualization to latest kirkstone HEAD
  - updated meta-phytec to latest kirkstone HEAD
  - updated meta-freescale to latest kirkstone HEAD
  - updated meta-raspberrypi to latest kirkstone HEAD
  - removed now obsolete meta-phytec_do_not_overwrite_BBMASK.patch
  - adapted linux-imx_%.bbappend to meta-phytec changes
  - omnect-os-image: install kernel-image explicitly to rootfs
    (meta-phytec removed it from rootfs for phyimx8 devices)

## [kirkstone-0.22.7] Q4 2023
- iot-identity-service: bumped to 1.4.6
- iotedge: bumped to 1.4.21
- do-client: bumped to 1.1.0

## [kirkstone-0.22.6] Q4 2023
- kas: added dev/own_mirror_only.yaml to allow usage of a dedicated mirror only

## [kirkstone-0.22.5] Q3 2023
- omnet-os-distro.conf/machine configs: introduce possibility to define
  different rootfs maximum sizes for release and development images
  Note: currently the sizes are still identical for both image types, only
  distinction upon setting of OMNECT_RELEASE_IMAGE was added

## [kirkstone-0.22.4] Q3 2023
- grub-cfg: deploy grub.cfg to `DEPLOYDIR`

## [kirkstone-0.22.3] Q3 2023
- omnect-os-image: fixed wic image dependency for devices using grub

## [kirkstone-0.22.2] Q3 2023
- welotec eg500: refactored wic image to use the correct grub.cfg;
  NOTE: you have to inject `recipes-omnect/grub-cfg/grub-cfg/grub-usb.cfg`
  into the `boot` partition `/EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg` now, if you want to be able
  to boot from usb.
  (this enables flash-mode-2 to flash the correct grub.cfg independent of the
  used omnect-os-initramfs)

## [kirkstone-0.22.1] Q3 2023
- grub-cfg: append `APPEND` to kernel cmdline

## [kirkstone-0.22.0] Q3 2023
- omnect-os-initramfs:
  - introduced fsck status handling
    (writes fsck error state to /run/omnect-device-service/fsck.json)
  - refactored fsck and reformat handling
  - log with identifier "omnect-os-initramfs"
  - removed `get_block_device`
  - refactored ownership and permissions of /run/omnect-device-service/
- systemd-tmpfilesd: refactored permissions of
  /run/omnect-device-service/ssh_tunnel/

## [kirkstone-0.21.1] Q3 2023
- iot-hub-device-update: fixed CancelApply for swupdate_handler_v1,
  so that the correct revert function is called from the adu-swupdate.sh script

## [kirkstone-0.21.0] Q3 2023
- added bootloader-env recipe: `bootloader_env.sh` as wrapper for
  `fw_{setenv,printenv}` (u-boot) vs `grub-editenv` (grub)
- initramfs flash-mode-2: added workaround for filesystem problems of boot
  partition when kernel and/or initramfs are loaded from boot partition via grub
- README.md: simplified documentation due to introduction of
  `bootloader_env.sh` wrapper
- kernel: generic configuration of `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS_INDEX` so it is equal
  on all platforms

## [kirkstone-0.20.0] Q3 2023
- omnect-device-service:
  - update to version 0.14.0
  - add ssh_tunnel_user
  - add sudoers entry with ssh command permissions for ssh_tunnel_user

## [kirkstone-0.19.12] Q3 2023
- linux-welotec eg500: compile network driver into kernel
  (initramfs otherwise would have to load the module for
  flash-mode 2)
- initramfs flash-mode 2:
  - don't use variable OMNECT_ETH0
    (eth names differ between initramfs and booted omnect-os,
    because systemd renames devices)
  - handle efibootmgr entry for efi devices

- omnect-os-image:
  - moved packages previously defined in OMNECT_TOOLS_DEFAULT directly into IMAGE_INSTALL
    and removed variable completely
    (definition of tools via kas no longer supported, so no fallback needed anymore)
  - added regression test for packages defined in variable OMNECT_DEVEL_TOOLS which checks

## [kirkstone-0.18.28] Q2 2023

  (tools defined in OMNECT_DEVEL_TOOLS - either as defined in identically
   named environment variable or tools from OMNECT_DEVEL_TOOLS_DEFAULT as
   fallback - were also part in release images and neither variable was listed
   in os-release)

    condition:

  - license is now `MIT | Apache 2.0`

   a reboot after a successful update validation. from userland you could see
   `bootpart=3`, but u-boot took the default value `bootpart=2`)

## [kirkstone-0.18.6] Q1 2023

## [kirkstone-0.18.3] Q1 2023
- kernel: added CIFS support to allow taking advantage of Samba/Windows shares
  when wanting to store device data for whatever reason

## [kirkstone-0.18.2] Q1 2023
- iot-hub-device-update: added "compatibilityId" to "additionalDeviceProperties" in du-config.json

## [kirkstone-0.18.1] Q1 2023
- iot-hub-device-update: timer triggers service if it wasn't activated 5mins
  after boot
  (this is meaningful if the service activation is skipped at first start and
  thus the service never had the state "inactive". this can happen in an update
  validation scenario. a successful update validation should trigger the start
  of the service via path activation by deleting the barrier path which caused
  the activation skip in the first place. this additional timer setting is a
  backup, if the path activation after deleting the barrier path fails.)

## [kirkstone-0.18.0] Q1 2023

- iot-hub-device-update:
  - patched in order to restart in case an unauthenticated:no-network message was received
  - this avoids bugs where reported properties might be empty after iot-identity-service was restarted for some reason

    doesn't exist
