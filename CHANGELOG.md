- use hardcoded reference for enrollment (0.4.0) and iot-module-template (0.2.0)

## [> 3.1.11.2342287] Q4 2021
- add redundant u-boot environment

## [> 3.1.11.1407973] Q4 2021
- distro.conf: remove tune of IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR

## [> 3.1.11.537558] Q4 2021
- update partition schema
- add development tools: valgrind, ltrace, strace, gdbserver, htop, lsof, curl, tcpdump, ethtool, lshw, sysstat, ldd, parted, smartmontools, mmc-utils, sudo, ps, dd
- add ics-dm user
- disable direct root login (concerns SSH, serial console and graphical console)
- allow login using ics-dm user; subsequent sudo possible

## [> 3.1.11.531910] Q4 2021
- unbundle initramfs from kernel to speed up build times from sstate cache
  (before the kernel and modules got build every time when building with
  sstate cache)

## [> 3.1.11.1102] Q4 2021
- enrollment: install new enrollment-patch-config-toml@.service

## [> 3.1.11.1073] Q4 2021
- u-boot boot.scr: only use saveenv on first boot to minimize flash wear out
  and robustness against power loss at boot
- u-boot raspberry-pi: patch u-boot to get ftd_addr from firmware and not
  from env; without this patch you can not boot with hdmi connected when
  first boot was without hdmi (or not boot without hdmi when hdmi was
  connected on first boot)

## [> 3.1.11.1050] Q4 2021
- update meta-openembedded to latest dunfell head
- update meta-rust to latest master head to include rust-1.54.0
- update meta-swupdate to latest dunfell head
- update meta-virtualization to latest dunfell head
- update meta-raspberrypi to latest dunfell head
- iotedge-cli,iotedge-daemon:
  ignore all instances of #[warn], #[deny], and #[forbid] lint directives
  otherwise edgelet-docker will fail with rust 1.54 caused by #[deny(rust_2018_idioms)]
- delete fstab: prevent rw remount of "/"
- initramfs: mount /boot and tmpfs
- wifi-commissioning-gatt-service: update to 0.1.4; integrate cli parameter handling
- ics-dm-os image recipes: fix SUMMARY resp. DESCRIPTION

## [> 3.1.11.1039] Q4 2021
- distro: disable systemd-sysusers (uids/gids created by systemd-sysusers
  could potentially clash with uids/gids introduced by later update images)

## [>= 3.1.11.x ] Q4 2021
- add kas files to build meta-ics-dm for different configurations
- implicit update to dunfell 3.1.11 (in kas/distro/poky.yaml)
- implicit update to meta-openembedded dunfell HEAD 2e7e98cd0cb82db214b13224c71134b9335a719b
  (in kas/distro/ics-dm-os.yaml)
- Readme: document default partition layout
- os-release.bbappend: adapt to meta-ics-dm layer handling in kas
- distro.conf: increase IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR to 1.1 otherwise ext4 image
  overhead will not fit into IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE and IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE

## [> 3.1.10.912 ] Q3 2021
- add wifi-commissioning-gatt-service
- add bluez 5.61 from poky honister (required by wifi-commissioning-gatt-service)
- enable wpa_supplicant with default config for wlan0 per default if
  DISTRO_FEATURE 'wifi' is set
- wpa_supplicant ctrl is restricted to group wpa_supplicant for
  wpa_supplicant@wlan0

## [> 3.1.10.768 ] Q3 2021
- add tmpfiles.d handling for /etc/aziot in
  /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/iot-identity-service.conf as fallback to fix permissions
- iotedge: change dependencies to iot-identity-service from head of release/1.2 branch
  to a hard commit (head of release/1.2 branch at time iotedge repo was tagged to 1.2.x)

## [> 3.1.10.761 ] Q3 2021
- update azure-iot-sdk-c to LTS_07_2021_Ref01

## [> 3.1.9.693 ] Q3 2021
- update do-client to v0.7.0

## [> 3.1.9.676 ] Q3 2021

- update iot-identity-service to 1.2.2
- update iotedge to 1.2.3

## [> 3.1.8.468] Q2 2021
- fix systemds "ConditionFirstBoot" check on first boot by removing
  empty machine-id in rootfs
- write boot.scr dynamically
- expanding data is now handled by initramfs on first boot, if configured
  via DISTRO_FEATURE 'resize-data'
- removed expand-data systemd service
- removed systemd mount handling and mount dependencies
- added ics-dm-os-initramfs which mounts overlays/bind mounts before systemd
  starts
- patch u-boot to allow boot images > 8MB
- updata-ca-certificates is called on first boot, to possibly propagate
  injected certificates
- first-boot.service starts script on first boot
- patched eis_utils to propagate GatewayHostName to connection string in
  nested environments
- permission handling for manual SaS authentication in iot-identity service
- build/install iot-identity-service with tpm regardless of DISTRO_FEATURES;
  currently you can not separate aziot-tpmd from installing, aziotctl has hard
  dependencies to it

## [> 3.1.8.404]  Q2 2021
- updated iotedge to 1.2.1
- updated iot-identity-service to rev 427fe7624954118577bc083b83fa216430c2a085 from release/1.2 branch
- version schema uses pokys version + build number suffix
- initial distro config for ics-dm-os
- moved recipes depending on meta-virtualization into dynamic layer

- odroid kernel fragment for overlayfs (mandatory for our readonly rootfs)
- odroid kernel fragment for recommended systemd settings
- initial support for odroid-c2 device
- added dynamic-layers for bsps adaptions (raspberrypi and odroid)

- removed dependency to meta-elbb
- added iot-module-template
- configurable DISTRO_FEATURES: ics-dm-demo, iotedge, tpm
- added AIS (https://github.com/Azure/iot-identity-service) for provisioning iot-hub-device-update and iotedge
- removed ics-dm-iot-hub-device-update_git.bb
