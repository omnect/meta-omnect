# Appends a string to the name of the local version of the U-Boot image; e.g. "-1"; if you like to update the bootloader via

# Note: `UBOOT_LOCALVERSION` should be also increased on change of variables
#   `APPEND`,
#   `OMNECT_UBOOT_WRITEABLE_ENV_FLAGS`

# Note: also changes which affect the content of the boot partition, e.g.
# `CMDLINE_*` in rpi-cmdline.bb should be reflected with an increase of
# `UBOOT_LOCALVERSION` to force an update of the entire bootloader
# (proprietary rpi bootloader + u-boot)
